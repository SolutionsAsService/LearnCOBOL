# COBOL Sample Files and Learning Resources

Welcome to our COBOL Sample Files and Learning Resources repository! This repository is designed for individuals who are new to COBOL as well as those looking to refresh their knowledge. It contains a variety of sample COBOL programs and resources aimed at facilitating a practical understanding of COBOL programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need a COBOL compiler installed on your system. [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) is a free COBOL compiler that is widely used and supports various operating systems.

### Installation

- **Windows**: Download the installer from [GnuCOBOL's official page](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/).
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager to install GnuCOBOL. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `sudo apt-get install gnucobol`.
- **macOS**: Install Homebrew, then run `brew install gnucobol`.

### Running a COBOL Program

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cobol-sample-files.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Compile a COBOL program using the GnuCOBOL compiler with the command `cobc -x -free -o program_name program_name.cbl`.
4. Run the compiled program with `./program_name`.

## Repository Structure

- `/samples` - Contains sample COBOL programs covering various topics such as file handling, calculations, and data processing.
- `/exercises` - Practice exercises to test your COBOL skills.
- `/solutions` - Solutions to the exercises provided in the `/exercises` directory.

## Learning Resources

Here are some additional resources to help you learn COBOL:

- [GnuCOBOL Programmer's Guide](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) - A comprehensive guide to the GnuCOBOL compiler and COBOL programming.
